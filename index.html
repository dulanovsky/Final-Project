    <h5>Step 1: Wedging</h5>
    <p>
      Wedging is fancy jargon for hitting and mushing the clay a bunch of times in a special way. Don't be fooled by its apparent simplicity: proper wedging is all-important to a successful piece. Wedging forces all the air bubbles out of the clay, which ensures a smooth and beautiful bowl, but more importantly safeguards from any major cracks or explosions when the piece goes in the kiln.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a thousand ways to wedge, and they all work perfectly well if executed correctly. Wedging can become much more difficult if using a large amount of clay, so a beginner is encouraged to start with about a grapefruit-sized chunk of clay. When you begin, make sure the canvas-stretched table you're working on is a bit moist; wedging can dehydrate clay, which makes it much harder to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out this video for one wedging method, and feel free to look around for a different one if you're having difficulties with this method.

    <h5>Step 2: Rolling a Slab</h5>
    <p>
      Now that you have some usable clay, it's time to start the bowl. We're making a slab-based bowl, which means we need to start by rolling out a slab of clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, make sure to moisten the table to avoid drying out the clay. Then begin to roll out the clay with a large rolling pin, just like rolling out sugar cookie dough, until it is at a uniform thickness of between 1/4"-1/3". Remember, slow and steady wins the race! If you roll too quickly, you'll stress out the clay and cause cracks and tears. You can also flip over the entire slab every few rolls to keep it even; remember, the table is the part that's really imposing flatness on the clay, not the rolling pin. Check out this video for an example:
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oszILuetbQ">How to Roll a Slab of Clay</a>
    <p>
      Here is what my slab looked like:
    </p>
    <img src="slab of clay.jpg" class= "rotateimg90"/>
  </div>

  <div class= "step" id= "step3location">
    <h5>Step 3: Using a Form</h5>
    <p>
      It's time to give the bowl its shape. Cover a styrofoam ball with thin plastic (the kind you get for vegetables at the grocery store). Cut a circle out of the slab of clay (mine was about 7 inches) and lay it gently over the plastic-covered form. Rub some water into it with a sponge, then use a red rubber rib to smooth it over on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Convince' the clay to fit that shape by using your hands to press it onto the form from all directions, starting from the top and gently working down the sides. Don't force it! This process may be a little slow, but if you don't take your time, you'll stress out the clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the clay sit out in a cool, dry place for about 5 hours. Remember, if you leave it out too long, it'll go bone-dry and won't be usable anymore. If you can't be sure of about 5-6 hours, you can always cover the clay in plastic, which 'freezes' it in its state until you have time to get to work/ time-dry it.

  </div>

  <div class= "step" id= "step4location">
    <h5>Step 4: Remove from Form and Refine Edge</h5>
    <p>
      To remove the bowl from the form without screwing up the shape, first remove the styrofoam ball from the plastic (leaving the plastic attached to the clay), then gently peel the plastic away while twisting it to remove safely.
    </p>
    <img src="bowl off form.jpg" class= "rotateimg90"/>
    <p>
      Refining the edge is a very important part of the process: you can make it thick or thin, and there's no law that says the edge must be a perfect even circle. Get creative! I cut a dip into my edge using an xacto knife.
    </p>
    <img src="cut the edge.jpg" class= "rotateimg90"/>
    <p>
      A freshly cut edge will be choppy and unattractive. Use a moist ribbing sponge to round over the edge. Let your bowl sit out for another 4-5 hours, until it gets to a harder stage called 'leather-hard'.
    </p>

    <h5>Step 5: Making a Bottom</h5>
    <p>
      There are two options for the bottom of a bowl. You can either add feet, or flatten it so it can stand. To flatten it, you will need to wet-sand it. This is fairly simple: you just need to make a puddle of water on a canvas surface, then press your bowl down while sliding it along the table to 'sand' it down.
    </p>
    <img src="wet sanding.jpg" class= "rotateimg90"/>
    <p>
      If you'd rather add feet, you'll need to follow the instructions in this video to attach them:
    </p>

  <div class= "step" id= "step6location">
    <h5>Step 6: Refining Surface</h5>
    <p>
      The first thing to do with the surface of the bowl is to scrape it down. You'll know you're at the right stage if your clay comes off looking like chocolate shavings. Use a metal scraper to reduce the thickness and define the curve of the bowl as you like it. Check out this video:
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, you can add decorative texture. You can use anything from a peach pit to a seashell to impress a texture (if you want), or carve a texture design using a needle tool.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class= "step" id= "step7location">
    <h5>Step 7: Slip Decoration and Firing/Glazing</h5>
    <p>
      While your clay is still leather-hard, you can use slip (a mix of clay, water, and dye) to decorate it either using slip trailing or sgraffito.

    <p>
      Now that you're finished, you can let your piece go bone-dry to be fired then glazed. Your teacher will help you with the bisque firing and then show you how to glaze your piece before it goes in the kiln. Good luck!
