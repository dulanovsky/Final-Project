  <h4>What's this?</h4>
  <p>
    This is an instruction manual on how to make a basic ceramic bowl (provided a fully-stocked studio), with lots of helpful links to instruction videos, and photos that follow (most of) the process!

    <h5>Step 1: Wedging</h5>
    <p>
      Wedging is fancy jargon for hitting and mushing the clay a bunch of times in a special way. Don't be fooled by its apparent simplicity: proper wedging is all-important to a successful piece. Wedging forces all the air bubbles out of the clay, which ensures a smooth and beautiful bowl, but more importantly safeguards from any major cracks or explosions when the piece goes in the kiln.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a thousand ways to wedge, and they all work perfectly well if executed correctly. Wedging can become much more difficult if using a large amount of clay, so a beginner is encouraged to start with about a grapefruit-sized chunk of clay. When you begin, make sure the canvas-stretched table you're working on is a bit moist; wedging can dehydrate clay, which makes it much harder to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out this video for one wedging method, and feel free to look around for a different one if you're having difficulties with this method.

    <h5>Step 2: Rolling a Slab</h5>
    <p>
      Now that you have some usable clay, it's time to start the bowl. We're making a slab-based bowl, which means we need to start by rolling out a slab of clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, make sure to moisten the table to avoid drying out the clay. Then begin to roll out the clay with a large rolling pin, just like rolling out sugar cookie dough, until it is at a uniform thickness of between 1/4"-1/3". Remember, slow and steady wins the race! If you roll too quickly, you'll stress out the clay and cause cracks and tears. You can also flip over the entire slab every few rolls to keep it even; remember, the table is the part that's really imposing flatness on the clay, not the rolling pin. Check out this video for an example:

  </div>

  <div class= "step" id= "step3location">
    <h5>Step 3: Using a Form</h5>
    <p>
      It's time to give the bowl its shape. Cover a styrofoam ball with thin plastic (the kind you get for vegetables at the grocery store). Cut a circle out of the slab of clay (mine was about 7 inches) and lay it gently over the plastic-covered form.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Convince' the clay to fit that shape by using your hands to press it onto the form from all directions, starting from the top and gently working down the sides. Don't force it! This process may be a little slow, but if you don't take your time, you'll stress out the clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the clay sit out in a cool, dry place for about 5 hours. Remember, if you leave it out too long, it'll go bone-dry and won't be usable anymore. If you can't be sure of about 5-6 hours, you can always cover the clay in plastic, which 'freezes' it in its state until you have time to get to work/ time-dry it.
