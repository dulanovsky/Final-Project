  <h4>What's this?</h4>
  <p>
    This is an instruction manual on how to make a basic ceramic bowl (provided a fully-stocked studio), with lots of helpful links to instruction videos, and photos that follow (most of) the process!

    <h5>Step 1: Wedging</h5>
    <p>
      Wedging is fancy jargon for hitting and mushing the clay a bunch of times in a special way. Don't be fooled by its apparent simplicity: proper wedging is all-important to a successful piece. Wedging forces all the air bubbles out of the clay, which ensures a smooth and beautiful bowl, but more importantly safeguards from any major cracks or explosions when the piece goes in the kiln.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a thousand ways to wedge, and they all work perfectly well if executed correctly. Wedging can become much more difficult if using a large amount of clay, so a beginner is encouraged to start with about a grapefruit-sized chunk of clay. When you begin, make sure the canvas-stretched table you're working on is a bit moist; wedging can dehydrate clay, which makes it much harder to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out this video for one wedging method, and feel free to look around for a different one if you're having difficulties with this method.

    <h5>Step 2: Rolling a Slab</h5>
    <p>
      Now that you have some usable clay, it's time to start the bowl. We're making a slab-based bowl, which means we need to start by rolling out a slab of clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, make sure to moisten the table to avoid drying out the clay. Then begin to roll out the clay with a large rolling pin, just like rolling out sugar cookie dough, until it is at a uniform thickness of between 1/4"-1/3". Remember, slow and steady wins the race! If you roll too quickly, you'll stress out the clay and cause cracks and tears. You can also flip over the entire slab every few rolls to keep it even; remember, the table is the part that's really imposing flatness on the clay, not the rolling pin. Check out this video for an example:

    <h5>Step 2: Rolling a Slab</h5>
    <p>
      It's time to cut out the shape of our bowl. I wanted a nice, even edge on my bowl, so I cut out a circle. If you want a different shape, like an oval or a square, that's entirely possible! Your limit is your imagination. The best way to cut out a shape is to find flat object with the appropriate size and shape to use as a cutting aid. I used a circular disk of a diameter of about 8". When you find a shape to use, lay it gently over your slab, and use a fettling knife or an xacto knife to cut around it. It's best to do this while standing, and try to make one smooth motion to achieve an even cut.

    Computer science embraces problem solving, hardware, algorithms, and perspectives that help people utilize computers to address real-world problems in contemporary life. As the study of computer science is evolving, the careful design of the AP Computer Science A course and exam continues to strive to engage a diverse student population, including female and underrepresented students, with the rigorous and rewarding concepts of computer science. Students who take the AP Computer Science A course and exam are well prepared to continue their study of computer science and its integration into a wide array of computing and STEM-related fields.
  </p>
  <p class="later-paragraph">
    The AP Computer Science A curriculum provides resources, such as application-related labs, that connect with students with diverse interests, particularly female and underrepresented student populations. The course is engaging and underscores the importance of communicating solutions appropriately and in ways that are relevant to current societal needs. Thus, a well-designed, modern AP Computer Science A course can help address traditional issues of equity, access, and broadening participation in computing while providing a strong and engaging introduction to fundamental areas of the discipline.
  </p>
  <p class="later-paragraph">
    The AP Computer Science A course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AP Computer Science A course curriculum is compatible with many CS1 courses in colleges and universities. Some colleges and universities may organize their curricula in alternative ways, so that the topics of the AP Computer Science A course are spread over several college courses, with other topics from computer science interspersed.
